# React - The Complete Guide

## Section 3: React Basics and Working with Components

1. Module Introduction
2. What are Components? And Why is React All About Them?
3. React Code is Written in a Desclarative Way
4. Creating a New React Project
   - Install React (_$ npx create-react-app react-the-complete-guide_)
   - Run React app (_$ npm start_)
   - Deleted unnecessary files from src folder; copied from repo the codes for App.js, index.css & index.js
5. Analyzing a Standard React Project
   - **index.js** is the first file that is run
   - **App.js** is the root (or main) component; it uses JSX expressions
6. Introducing JSX
   - **JSX** stands for JavaScript Xml
7. How React Works
   - Discuss how React transforms JSX expressions to JavaScript codes
8. Building a First Custom Component
   - create a folder to hold custom components
   - create a component called ExpenseItem.js
   - call the component from App.js with `<ExpenseItem></ExpenseItem>`
9. Writing More Complex JSX Code
   - There must only be ONE root element per return statement
10. Adding Basic CSS Styling
    - Create a CSS file called ExpenseItem.css under components folder
    - Apply the classes (using **className**) in ExpenseItem CSS file to ExpenseItem.js
11. Outputting Dynamic Data and Working with Expressions in JSX
12. Passing Data via "props"
13. Adding "normal" JavaScript Logic to Components
14. Splitting Components into Multiple Components
15. Time to Practice: React and Component Basics
16. The Concept of "Composition" ("children props")
